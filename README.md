# Ferris-GAN
GAN to create pictures of my dog, CS 131 Final Project

FALL 2022

This project was developed to explore GANs in a setting where limited data was available. To make the project more fun, I did this using a custom dataset containing pictures of my dog.
For this project, I trained a generator CNN and a discriminator CNN from scratch, first perfecting my layer archeticture with three stages 
1. Training a GAN on MNST
2. Training a GAN on pictures of my dog (Ferris)
3. Training an additional descriminator network to descriminate Ferris from a teddy bear (since I think he looks like a teddy bear!)

Tools Used and Learning Topics: 
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Pytorch
- CUDA
- Image data
- Building model architecture from scratch
- Training model from scratch
